1,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a ìpressure cookerî device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isnít that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the ìbad guys.î Unfortunately, our leadership ñ who ostensibly wants to protect us ñ finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ñ who famously ended ìstop-and-friskî profiling in his city ñ was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. ìThere is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,î de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. ìWe believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and Ö agencies are at full alertî, he said. Isnít ìan intentional actî terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James OíNeill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New Yorkís Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word ìterrorismî is defined. ìA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.î Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his ìobviousî assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that ìwe need to do everything we can to support our first responders ñ also to pray for the victimsî and that ìwe need to let this investigation unfold.î Trump was more direct. ìI must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows whatís going on,î he said. ìBut boy we are living in a timeówe better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. Itís a terrible thing thatís going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.î

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as ìsoft targets.î Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

2,"Last week I wrote an article titled ìDonald Trumpís Amazing Weekî which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and ìNever Trumpersî everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.

The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the ìtoss up stateî category.

Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trumpís childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the planís offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parentís expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trumpís childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parentís decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.

Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New Yorkís most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trumpís excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trumpís unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clintonís health following her fainting at last weekís September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trumpís health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clintonís health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.

Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something ìunpresidentialî. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could ìmess up his hairî. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said ìyesî to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the ìTrump Trainî. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, itís another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.

Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed ìtwo years early and under budgetî, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the ìbirther issueî. Trump took the microphone and said ìNot to mention her in the same breath,î (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) ìHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,î he said. ìPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.î Trump said.

Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another ìamazing week.î

3,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughterís apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clintonís apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillaryís stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

4,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world.

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led ìto a collision of culturesî but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

ìI believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,î Obama said. ìIn order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.î

5,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

ìIíve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I canít stand how weíre treated,î the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

David T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

ìItís a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldnít have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,î she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolinaís most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

David T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

ìRelease. Release. The whole damn tape,î the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,BuzzFeed
6,"I canít wait for ìWeekend at Chelseaísî to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clintonís slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups ñ these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low ñ would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a ìminor setbackî to her ìinevitableî victory.

The American people arenít buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more ìconspiracy theoryî dismissals. Mrs. Clintonís ìmild cold,î er, ìseasonal allergies,î I mean ìheat exhaustion,î that is to say ìminor case of pneumoniaî is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a ìmystery manî who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable ìepisodesî (or otherwise freezes up with a brain ìshort-circuitî during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinsonís disease ñ a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has ìpneumoniaî required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They wonít, but they should. I wonder what official ìdiagnosisî weíll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though theyíve been there a hundred times before. ìNothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clintonís sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ëpowered throughí yesterday going door-to-door.î

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. Sheís proven, yet again, that she canít be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. Sheís a liar. Thatís her default mode. Sheís corrupt. And sheís sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else ñ including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clintonís sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. ìDo not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoiceî (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trumpís supporters as a ìracistî and ìirredeemableî ìbasket of deplorables,î has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement ñ especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her ìfriend and mentor.î Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags ñ the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Whoís the racist?

Iím praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You canít help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

Itís almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything sheís ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS sheís put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, ìMany are the plans in a personís heart, but it is the LORDís purpose that prevails.î

Am I saying thereís no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, thereís always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clintonís political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector ñ a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

7,"Hillary Clintonís campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday nightís big debate: Donít let Donald Trump get away with it.

And Trumpís campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clintonís team is just trying to ìgame the refs.î

Story Continued Below

The debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clintonís post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a ìdead heat.î

ìThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,î Silver tweeted.

During the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clintonís aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.

ìWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,î Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told ìCBS This Morning,î adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, ìthat that simply be checked.î

ìThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,"" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.

But Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trumpís claim that Holt may be unfair to him because heís a Democrat and the system is ìvery unfair.î The ìNBC Nightly Newsî anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.

ìI donít know that he knew what Lester Holtís voter registration was,î said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. ìHe didnít lie,î Conway said at one point, explaining that ìa lie would mean that he knew the manís party registration.î

In a presidential cycle thatís seen endless debates about debates, Mondayís theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldnít try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.

But Clintonís campaign has beat up on Holtís NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trumpís false assertion that he didnít support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.

The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. ìIn our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,î Janet Brown, the commissionís executive director, told CNNís ìReliable Sources.î

When it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, ìI donít think itís a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.î

For her part, Clinton wonít let Trumpís lies ìgo by the wayside,î press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldnít, either.

ìThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,î he said. ìLester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidatesí performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He canít possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.î

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.

ìI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns ó and what it should be ó is that the moderator is not the person whoís running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,î he said. ìYou can hold people accountable, thereís no question, but I donít think itís the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so theyíre making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.î

Trumpís campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton campís preparation for two Trumps.

ìWe donít want Donald Trumpís lies and distortions to be a distraction. Weíre hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,î Mook told NBCís ìToday.î

Asked about Clintonís rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that ìit just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just donít know that.î

View One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016)

But Conway shot down the notion that thereís any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is ìto become humanî during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that ìOverprogramming leads to short circuits,î and Conway joined the pile-on.

ìHeís not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,î Conway said. ìAnd thatís a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that havenít been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.î

After Mook warned against ìa double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,î Conway added that the two campaign managers ìare living in parallel universes.î

ìI mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying itís your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,î she said. ìI'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasnít necessarily been beneficial.î

Aside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clintonís willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.

ìIím worried that some of the headlines are already written, that theyíre conclusions in search of evidence,î Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.

ìWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,î Conway said. ìNinety-two percent of at least two of our embedsí tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we canít get a fair shake from certain people.î

Conway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogulís performance.

ìSo if she ends up saying to him, ëThatís just not true, youíre distorting my record, youíre being mean to a woman,í and then people will say, ëHe was mean to a woman,í and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up ó even if itís not true,î she said. ìSo that would be my concern, that heís not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that sheís not a great debater, that sheís not really ready for tonight the way he is, that sheís going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.î

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to ""just let loose"" and be himself ó and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.

""She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox and Friends."" ""So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be ó he's just going to be like you see him on ó when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.""

8,"Iíve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, Iím pretty much baffled.

The problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clintonís strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknessesóespecially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: ìYouíve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then youíre one of those whoís created the mess weíre in.î So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.

Story Continued Below

Indeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what Iíve called ìpolitical judoîóturning an opponentís strength against her. (ìYes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe thatís why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedyís chief speechwriter, are backing me.î)

Further, there's a senseóa highly limited senseóin which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, ìI'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.î It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).

By contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of ìhonest and trustworthyî? If Trump can be convinced by his handlersóassuming they existóto avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trumpóbankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Postóbut those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trumpóand he's still standing.

Does any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and donít do, based on a half-century or so of history.

The Focus Is on ìMomentsîóBut Theyíre Not Always The Key

Ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:

ìNixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter ëthere you go again,í then asked Americans ëare you better off?í Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondaleís ëyouth and inexperience.í Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wifeís rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.î

These are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. Itís why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable linesóìzingersîóto win the attention and admiration of the audience. (Itís also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, ìYouíve all become theater critics.î)

But in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, itís the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the îaha!î moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obamaís petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the presidentís most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.

The presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a ìmomentî unlike any in debate history; thatís clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: ìhe seemed pretty reasonableî or ìshe knows what sheís talking about and he doesnít.î This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.

There Are Three Debates, Not OneóAnd That Can Matter A Whole Lot

One key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28thóbarely a week before the election.

Every other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. Thatís what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; itís also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.

Here, I think, is an opening for Clintonóespecially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a questionóand they are usually very lame ""what can you do for my daughter?"" questionsóinto answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trumpís astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bushís commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: ""What about Dingell-Norwood?"" The opportunity for her is to argueófrom experienceóthat what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting formatówith dozens of ìrealî people as participantsómakes the resort to personal insults highly risky).

Trump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo

The potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.

ìWell,î he said, ìthey've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.î

Judo, however, can cut both ways. Thereís a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.

ìWell, you might be successful, Donald, but we really donít know because youíre the first presidential candidate ever who wonít show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, whoís worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didnít start with millions from his father, says youíre a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admitóyouíre way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.î

Debates Are NOT Decisive

One last note. Itís easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (ìReagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.î ìObama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-electedÖî). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obamaís clear if modest popular vote victory.

In their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other ìgame-changersî with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romneyís first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the ìfundamentalsîóeconomic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorateóthe stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.

Of course, this cycle the ìfundamentalsî point to a very close race. So youíll probably want to tune in anyway

9,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadnít been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but heíd made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasnít long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generalsí butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldnít. He peeked into peopleís desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his internsí desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasnít until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music ó the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans ó and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what theyíd seen. (ìHey, bro, itís the president!î ìYeah, bro!î) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word ìISISî came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. Heíd just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasnít kidding. ìI want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,î heíd tell them. Theyíd laugh and say something like, ìHey, Mr. President, please donít ever say that again publicly!î Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each otherís eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, ìIs it about how youíre really a terrorist?î He looked at her and said, ìYes, actually.î She stopped eating her Popsicle. ìDonald Trump was right about you?î He nodded. ìAbout everything.î

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. Heíd made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (ìHonestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.î) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

ìIsnít that the plot of the first season of Homeland?î Hillary asked. Obama nodded. ìKind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.î

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didnít know what had given it away. Heíd been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? ìWait, what?î Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Boís eyes were really tiny LED screens. ìDid you know that when Bo barks,î Obama said, ìheís just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?î

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. ìYouíre a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?î Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, ìI feel like Iím short-circuiting!î Obama did his best to comfort her. ìBo does that sometimes. Then heíll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.î

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raismanís floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. ìIím sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,î Hillary apologized. ìDo you mean a fin?î Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: ìBut I havenít even told you the best part yet. Iím going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.î

ìIsis?î

ìNo, ISIS. All caps.î

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didnít want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought heíd be. He told her ìlike for realî they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, ìWeíll wait until Iím president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.î Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldnít stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to ìWonderwallî as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they donít like.

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the ìSteve Harvey Morning Show,î Clinton stressed that voters canít sit this one out.

Story Continued Below

ìEvery issue they care about is at stake in this election,î Clinton said. ìThis is not: ëOh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can ó you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.í No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.î

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether theyíre registered ìbecause I need you.î

ìWe gotta stand up and be counted in this election,î she added.

Clintonís comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

ìMy name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,î Obama said. ìTolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, thatís on the ballot right now.î

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans whoíve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but thatís the truth in Obamaís America.

Weíre all aware of the scandal at the Veteranís Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

ìWe have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,î he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. ìThank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.î Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. ìBut the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,î said Trump. ìHe will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And heíll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.î

Watch below:

Wouldnít it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care ñ a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans ñ donít you think itís time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I donít recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clintonís health constantly making headline, but itís also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

ïMore than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either ìbelow averageî or ìvery poorî health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. Thatís a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

ïThe share of voters who think Clintonís health is ìaverageî remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either ìabove averageî or ìexcellentî health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

ïVoters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clintonís potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, sheís one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60ís too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ëlooking oldí or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I canít see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillaryís health. The suspicion isnít from one particular thing, itís from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other maladyís. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinsonís, Alzheimerís, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ëconfused and needing napsí, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldnít mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someoneís arm.



Hereís an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter donít see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives sheís gasping for air. Itís incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack ó *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.

I cannot say that I donít understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. Itís justÖ is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of ìall things dangerousî then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. Itís not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasnít already hard enough in Obamaís America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being ìdisproportionatelyî targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, thatís ìreasonable suspicionî and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, itís not important to get evidence when itís fresh, because it could hurt a thugís feelings.

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

ìDefendants forced Woodís daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.î

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

ìDuring its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.î

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim peopleís faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

ìNowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.î

It referenced the jihad as,

ìa holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.î

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. Despite the fact the Thomas More Center has taken on this case neither the American Civil Liberties Union or the Freedom From Religion Foundation have weighed in on the issue.",ìPublic School Forced My Child To,BuzzFeed

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years heís been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, ìshould go to jail and be somebodyís girlfriend.î Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

ìNobody says the word ëprofile.í Everyone needs to get smart. Iím ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if Iím clear, then profile someone else. Itís emergency powers during war. Thereís a war going on.î

But what about the people who were being ìunfairlyî profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. ìIt is unfair. Thatís why the words ëtoo badí exists.î

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President heíll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, canít I?

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernickís protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, ìTebowingî celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as followsÖ

ìWhen people have belief in something,î said Tebow, ìor conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and itís all about standing for it the right way.í

Keyword is ìSTANDINGî which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. Heís a high paid bench player and heís being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, thatís cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonaldís next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And letís not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming youíre oppressed is really you admitting youíre lazy and donít want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasnít oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because heís smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. Heís too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

Donald Trumpís campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday nightís debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

ìI have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and itís a presidential virtue,î Conway told MSNBCís Morning Joe Tuesday. ìTo tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ëI was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.í That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.î

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday nightís debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as ìa man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.î After the debate, Trump told CNN that ììI was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,î indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clintonís husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trumpís attack might have been.

ìI think he could have said what was on millions of Americansí minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate whoís been good to women and who hasn't?î Conway said. ìTheyíre taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.î

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a ìknockout punchî that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trumpís campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

ìDonald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and thatís fine,î Conway said.

ìI don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,î she added. ìSo I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.î

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trumpís tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clintonís win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent ìwinningî results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clintonís infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. ìItís time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the storyís a little bit different as to how itís been portrayed so far, especially through social media,î he said.

As an officer, youíre hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first?

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because ìhe wouldíve gotten it, if I wanted it.î But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul ñ this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lieóa detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trumpís mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesnít want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bushís story reinforced what Trump was saying at ralliesóhe had played the ìcash for outcomesî political game for yearsóhe could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bushís oppositionóif Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush wouldíve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trumpís naÔve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwaldís point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadnít been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simpleóTrump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater ìscandalî for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trumpís other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his partyís base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on itís head.

Trumpís penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but itís a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, thereís no third option here:

Bush: ìThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on somethingóthat was generous and gave me moneyówas Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.î Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didnító Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didnít get it, because I was opposed toó Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling beforeó Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. Iím not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, ìDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?î Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect BushÖand I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didnít you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didnít change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

26,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible.

S Trumpís number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the companyís hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendmentís protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trumpís campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. ìThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,î the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nomineeís most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thielís parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now heís supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hoganís secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaireís then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOPís bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, ìEvery American has a unique identity. Iím proud to be gay, Iím proud to be a Republican,î after a lengthy rant against ìgovernment incompetence.î He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didnít pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

ìFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,î said the Department of Laborís OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ìOur nationís taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.î Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself ìvigorouslyî and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer ñ the federal government ñ of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his companyís hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

31,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL ó OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state areaÖ you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ëMuslims donít belong hereí. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

34,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they donít end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a childís genitals, so if youíre a parent of a child and youíve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, youíre a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from ìintentionally or knowingly touchingî the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they donít know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that ìprosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.î They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, yíall. Thereís no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But hereís an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majorityís logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Courtís help, Arizonaís child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiveróout of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the stateís residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizonaís parents and caregivers.

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ëClintoní in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed ìwatered-downî HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind thisÖ the question is, did the Clintons know about it. Iím betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

ìThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nationís largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,î said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ìwatered-downî HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ìlikely increasedî the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,ìThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,î was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundationís most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. ◊ 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clintonís decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

ìThe question becomes, ëhow many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,íî asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundationís aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ìwatered-downî drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ìmore than $1.8 million packages.î ìSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,î Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxyís generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clintonís charity have not severed ties with them either.

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check.

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Departmentís motion to dismiss TheDCNFís Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act.

37,"The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.

Insiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.

Story Continued Below

Thatís according to The POLITICO Caucus ó a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.

ìShe shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,î said a Nevada Democrat ó who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. ìHillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.î

ìThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,î a New Hampshire Democrat added. ìPresidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.î

One Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.

ìHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,î said the Ohio Democrat. ìShe will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.î

Republicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.

ìSomehow she needs to reverse the trend,î said an Ohio Republican. ìNever seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance ó and maybe her last chance.î

ìShe has to stop [Trumpís] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,î added a Virginia Republican. ìAll [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.î

Among those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure ó 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans ó most pointed to the GOP nomineeís volatile personality.

ìHillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,î said a Michigan Republican. ìThe pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.î

ìThe question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?î added a Michigan Democrat. ìCan he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?î

Two other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:

Most insiders expect Clinton to ìwinî the debate.

Majorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.

ìMedia look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,î said an Iowa Republican.

ì[Clintonís] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,î added a New Hampshire Democrat.

But not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton ó or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.

ìThe press wants Trump to win,î said a Florida Democrat. ìTheir disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.î

Some Republicans also claimed media bias ó in the other direction.

ìThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,î a Virginia Republican said. ìBut then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.î

Insiders think the debate will matter.

Asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.

Among Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent donít expect the debate to move the needle.

ìTrump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),î a Michigan Democrat predicted. ìThe moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.î

The numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldnít have a significant impact.

ìTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,î said a New Hampshire Republican. ìHe does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.î

But some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trumpís momentum with a strong performance Monday night.

ìIf she pins his ears back, [it helps her],î said an Iowa Republican. ìIf it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.î

Other insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.

ìWe're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,î an Iowa Republican said. ìSwing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.î

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian.

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, theyíre funded by Soros TOO! Itís called ëCommon Defense PACí and their mantra is: ìAs veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.î

Then on the ëleadership teamí page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called ìSenator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.î

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.orgís Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. ◊ 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to ìun-endorse Donald J. Trump.î ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans ìcame to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.î

Common sense PACís July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the groupís Director, Perry OíBrien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ëIraq Veterans Against the Warí bio describes him:

Perry OíBrien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors.

41,"CLEVELAND ó Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of ìstop-and-friskî policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trumpís up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

Story Continued Below

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that theyíve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King ó who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a ìgladiator.î King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

ìThe system is the problem, and heís the only gladiator that will take on the system,î King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a ìtown hallî with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address ìviolence in the black community,î Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

ìWe did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,î Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayorís office.

But even before Trumpís stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his ìever, ever, everî remark Tuesday night.

ìI don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,î Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. ìIs he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination ó when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?î

Trumpís polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal ó in the low single digits ó and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks ó ìWhat do you have to lose?î he says ó to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trumpís right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (ìthereís only one,î Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (ìtoughî), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ìa tough generalî) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (ìa wonderful womanî), who has helped with Trumpís black outreach.

ìIím different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,î Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the ìlaw and orderî candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been ìchokingî in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?î

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that ìthe systemî had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

ìEvery white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,î said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

ìI told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro ó I would use the N-word ó but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,î King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, ìAh, thereís only one Don King.î

Before King, Cohen, Trumpís attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the ìdisgusting, liberal, mainstream mediaî and its casting of Trump as a ìracist.î

ìThe word of the 2016 election has somehow become ëracist,íî Cohen complained. ìIíve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And letís not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. Itís disgraceful.î

Cohen said, ìNot only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.î

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldnít.

ìThey come and they take your vote,î Trump said, ìand they say theyíll see you in four years.î

44,"In March, in a bold ìOh yeah?î moment during an interview with the Washington Postís editorial board, Donald Trump took the paperís dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, ìI have quite a few more.î The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, ìCarter Page, PhD.î

Who?

Story Continued Below

Reporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trumpís big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he ìwill be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.î

This piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.

ìWhatís this guyís name?î says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.

ìI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,î says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. ìBut I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, ëHave you heard of this guy?íî

ìStrangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,î Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. ìIt's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.î

Someone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character whoíd all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.

This has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. ìIím going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,"" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. ""We want top-of-the-line professionals.î As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldnít tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldnít recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that ìHugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.î) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?

Enter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (ìI can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and theyíll say, ëCarter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?íî says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trumpís own campaign.

What I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. ìHeís an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,î says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russiaís state oil giant. ìPeople really respect him in this industry. Heís a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.î According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officialsóincluding Rosneft head Igor Sechinóduring a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, itís hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.

Page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his ìdeep tiesî with ìexecutives at Gazprom,î the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with ìextensive business interests in Russiaî and an office ìaround the corner from Trump Tower.î

Page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic Schoolís commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the ìhypocrisyî of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, ìWashington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.î He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a ìfamous American economistî and ìadviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.î

All of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of ìinsiders,î people who seem to be in Trumpís orbit but who may not haveóand may never have hadóany access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.

But someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate ìcorporate investigatorsî digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other wonít say who turned him on to Pageís scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putinís chief of staffóboth of whom are on the sanctions listówhen Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.

So the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?

***

I should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldnít talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Pageís father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.

This was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.

OK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didnít know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive rÈsumÈ.

Pageís biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the rÈsumÈ of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. ìHe spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,î his bio reads. ìHe was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.î

Those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Pageís tenure in Merrill Lynchís Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.

So I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasnít really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didnít know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynchís purported involvement in the deal. ìI donít think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,î says Craig . ìIt closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.î

When I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Pageís claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, ìI rolled my eyes at that one.î (He, too, said he hadnít heard of Page until Trumpís announcement.)

Fine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?

Turns out, they did.

ìHis nickname was stranichkin,î from the Russian word stranichka, or ìlittle page,î says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the companyís financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynchís Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. ìIt really irritated our team,î Torchinsky told me over Skype. ìWe worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and weíd have to correct them. These guys didnít know what they were talking about.î As for Page, ìHe made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,î Torchinsky says. ìWhen youíre dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.î

OK, harsh. But then I talked to Pageís former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. ìHe wasnít great and he wasnít terrible,î Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone ìwithout any special talents or accomplishments,î someone who was ìa gray spot.î ìWhat can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?î he asked me.

Page was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was ìjust the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,î says Aleksashenko.

When it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page ìwas not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.î When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, ìmildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.î And, says Aleksashenko, ìjudging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesnít really understand the topic.î

Trumpís putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, ìdid not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,î says Aleksashenko.

***

For the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. ìIn recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,î he wrote. ìAlthough commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.î He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye Westís ìNew Slavesî and the ìartistís creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairsî but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (ìSlave; Pronunciation: /slav/Öî), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.

His speech in Moscowís New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word ìironically.î ìFor the last 15 years, Iíve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,î he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldnít really speak Russianóhe had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: ìWe never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.î Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.

Page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. ìHe had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didnít really want to engage,î one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. ìThat blog post about the slaves. Thatís just Ö strange,î says the Council member.

ìHeís a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldnít be in the last decile, but heíd be in the second-to-last decile,î says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. ìYouíd have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.î

I shouldíve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaignís Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trumpís second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Pageís trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.

I was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Pageís connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russiaís most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?

But it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynchís London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. ìNo one let him into Gazprom,î Aleksashenko says. ìHe didnít go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Millerís hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.î Another of Pageís colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Pageís role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. ìPeople organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,î the former colleague said. ìHe hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a yearÖ I used to do this; it doesnít require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesnít mean theyíre close to him.î

But the meetings did provide him with something else. ìGazprom didnít need money at the time,î says the former colleague. ìThey were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.î Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies heís worked for to invest in them.

After Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his fatherís address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as ìfounder and managing partner,î even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue addressóthatís the one ìaround the corner from Trump Towerîó which was actually the address of a co-working space.

ìThatís Carter Page,î says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. ìThatís what heís been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, heís been trying to throw together these deals. Heís always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.î

In the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russiaís Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russiaís invasion of Ukraine.

ìI donít know this person,î said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Pageís trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. ìI give them money, I donít know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,î he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, ìDonít bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.î

ìYou are engaged in onanism,î said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. ìItís bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. Itís hard to have a meeting with him at all. Itís absurd.î

As for the FBI investigation, well, itís unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is ìno prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.î He added, ìthe story doesn't add up.î What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Pageís time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, ìwhether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.î

I got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trumpís senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?

ìWho?î says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.

ìHe has no formal role in the campaign,î Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.

Now my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicksís denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?

One way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.

One source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trumpís foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. ìThe only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,î Burt told me. ìAnd I told him Iíd never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, Iíve forgotten. Heís the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?î

Someone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessionsí chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trumpís Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldnít return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. ìIf he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,î this person told me.

ìIím not answering your questions,î Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaignís other spokesperson, says, ìCarter Page isnít someone Iíve interacted with.î Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: ìCarter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. Heís never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.î

***

Was Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump saidóheís my adviseróand what his associates saidóìWho?î Maybe I wasnít doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.

ìI donít know about his Russia fund, other than itís never really materialized,î says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. ìEvery conversation Iíve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. Theyíve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.î He went on. ìI couldnít name a project that I could connect Carterís name to, any project that actually happened.î

ìI donít know how heís earned a living off this,î the energy player says, ìbut I think heís been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, itís sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.î

Strangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, ìa lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, ëI want to be part of the team,íî says the Trump adviser. And thatís how it happened. ìHeís just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, ëHeís an adviser.í And now heís milking it for all itís worth.î

Now, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washingtonóor at least could plausibly market himself as one. ìI was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,î one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there ìin a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,î but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listenóand be impressed. ìHe was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,î the Russia specialist recalls. ìHe didnít say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.î

According to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Pageís trip to Russia, ìthe meetings did happen and thatís been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.î But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. ìItís not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?î said the staffer. ìIs he acting as a conduit in ways that are against Americaís national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. Itís whatís hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le CarrÈ novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?î

This seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But heís also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really isóand to try to turn a profit off of that. ìIf Page using his status as ëTrump advisorí for personal gain, thatís another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!î Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russiaís energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energyóbut the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: ìCarter Page, Ph.D.î Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.

For months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?

There doesnít seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putinís: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? ìI want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,î Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American electionóas we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think weíve finally grasped it.

Republican attacks on transgendered Americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when Virginia Republican Mark Cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their ìanatomical sex:î

Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.

He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but itís hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the studentís rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.",Virginia Republican Wants Schools To Check Children's Genitals Before Using Bathroom,Politifact

In an appearance on CBSís ìSunday Morning,î the ìMillion Reasonsî singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. ìIím very acutely aware that once I cross that property line Iím not free anymore,î Gaga said.

ìItís like Iím stepping out into this entirely different world where everybodyís allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I canít even call the police to help me because theyíre not doing anything wrong,î the singer complained. ìI realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me Iíd have to give up my privacy completely.

Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasnít her ìfirst choice,î as well as that ìhe couldnít have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,î due to the fact that ìI might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.î ìIt was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself.

ìSo, Iím sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but Iím afraid Iím going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever Iím out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well,î the singer revealed. ìAt this point Iím not sure whether thatís going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask thatíll cover my face, but what I do know is thatís the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon.

47,"In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldnít stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?

Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.

Dean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:

Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? ó Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016

Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.

And considering he hasnít released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.

Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.

Deanís assertion is just that ó an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything sheís not.

If this debate showed one thing, itís that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.

You can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loungís owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck.

Local people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog.

Many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loungís true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.

Loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since.

Well, as Harry Truman used to say, and as President Trump is putting into action, THE BUCK STOPS HERE!

You may have heard the snowflakes crying and complaining from their mothersí basements and their D.C. prison cells, those arrested for their massive temper tantrum in our Nationís Capital last weekend, about how President Trumpës staff removed the GLBT portals on the WhiteHouse.Gov site. Well, theyíre crying even louder now, because today, PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED HIS PEOPLE TO REMOVE THE SPANISH SPEAKING AND TRANSLATING PORTALS ON THE WHITEHOUSE.GOV WEBSITE!

Liberal rag L.A. Times reports:

President Trump, who chided his opponents during the campaign for speaking Spanish, has made a tangible change to the White House website to eliminate bilingual access. The site, which the Trump administration took over on Friday, no longer includes an option for translation into SpanishÖ Spokesman Sean Spicer suggested the translation option may return but made no specific commitment on timing when asked about it Monday. He spoke generally about the high volume of work facing the technology team during the changeover. ìWe are continuing to build out the websiteÖ,î Spicer said. ìWeíve got the IT folks working overtime on that now.î During a Republican primary debate, Trump lashed out at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush when he spoke Spanish. ìThis is a country where we speak English,î Trump said.

President Trump is spreading the message that we conservatives have been lamenting for years. This is America. We have a culture. We have a language. We have a set of laws and rules by which EVERYONE in this country is expected to abide.

58,"KALLSTADT, Germany ó Few places in Germany are as representative of the countryís heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumpís grandfather was born ó and from which he was later deported.

The hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-halfís drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pigís stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.

Trump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.

In fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.

Since a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. ìWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,î Steiniger tells POLITICO.

Trumpís rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. ìHe stands for everything thatís bad,î says Sarah B¸hler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the townís main square. B¸hler is a former local ìwine princess,î the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.

This year, a new dish appeared in the townís annual festival: Saumagen-Dˆner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. ìEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,î says B¸hler. ìPink, purple, doesnít matter.î

Tanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. ìThey donít get that we really donít give a damn about Trump,î says Huber. ìHeís never been here, and he apparently doesnít care about us, either.î

Donaldís grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintnerís family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including ìTrump,î ìDrombî and ìTrumpff,î according to local historians, or even ìDrumpf,î according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on ìTrump.î

Germany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.

Friedrichís father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.

He entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. ìBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,î said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.

According to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship ìas his own requestî four years after arriving in the U.S.

But Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.

But while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. ìMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,î Donald Trumpís American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.

Friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended ìto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,î he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blairís family history.

Back in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was ìto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.î

Friedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife ó pregnant once more ó had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donaldís father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.

ì[The authorities] said, ëYou are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,î says Walter. ìSo they left and they went back to America, and thatís why Donald and I are here.î

Friedrich ó now named Frederick ó died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.

In February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on ìKings of Kallstadt,î a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.

For months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trumpís cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.

On the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Towerís top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.

Her plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trumpís staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. ìHis assistant just couldnít be bothered,î she says.

ìHello, John,î Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousinís hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.

Trump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New Yorkís Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. ìAfterwards, I just kept on thinking, ëWhat on earth did I do?íî she says.

ìThe cake looks really good,î Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.

Until 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. ìThey grow them well in Kallstadt,î he told her during their meeting. ìThey grow them very well. Believe me. Itís good stock.î

ìWow, itís beautiful,î Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. ìThatís fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. Itís great.î

When their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trumpís son, Eric Trump.

ìHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt?î Wendel asked him.

ìKallstadt?î Trump Junior replied, ìNo, what is it?î","Donald Trump, Germanyís disfavored son ñ POLITICO",Politifact

North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called for a state of emergency in Charlotte Wednesday night after violence escalated as residents continued to protest the fatal shooting of an African-American man by a police officer a day prior.

""I have declared a State of Emergency & initiated efforts to deploy the Nat'l Guard & Highway Patrol to assist local law enforcement in CLT,"" McCrory tweeted late Wednesday night.

Story Continued Below

Civil unrest surged Tuesday as reports of the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott spread, prompting mass protests that went into the night. A dozen officers were injured during the unrest, according to a tweet from the local police department early Wednesday morning.

As protests continued Wednesday, reports emerged of a shooting that left a protester critically wounded, according to the Associated Press. Charlotte officials at first announced the man was dead but later amended the statement to say he was on life support. The police department has said the shooting was not committed by an officer.

""These police officers are showing a tremendous amount of courage and there's obviously a few hundred people who have come to our town center in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is a great city in and their major goal seems to be destruction and harm and that's wrong and it's unacceptable,"" McCrory said Wednesday night on CNN shortly after making the announcement.

""We cannot tolerate violence or tolerate the destruction of property and will not tolerate the attacks towards our police officers occurring right now and I feel very strongly about that right now,"" McCrory added. ""That is not the American way.""

The North Carolina governor added that though the state of emergency did not include a curfew, the possibility of one remained ""a very strong option.""

According to local reports, police officers saw Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and an officer shot the man.

60,"As Donald Trump courted African-American voters in Cleveland on Wednesday at a town hall taped by Fox News to air Thursday evening, he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level.

When asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community, Trump responded, ""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive, and you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

He added, ""New York City was incredible, the way that worked, so I think that could be one step you could do.""

The law enforcement policy ó in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed, then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations ó has been extremely controversial, particularly in communities of color, and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination. The policy gained prominence in the 1990s under New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is now a close confidant of Trump's.

Trump previously expressed his support for the policy, praising Giuliani for its success in New York. Trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration, believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism.

He has drawn the ire of some African-Americans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life.

On Tuesday night, Trump said, ""Our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before, ever, ever, ever"" ó seeming not to take into account slavery, institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement.

On Thursday morning, however, in an interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" he sought to amend his position, saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally.

""Now Chicago is out of control. I was referring to Chicago with stop and frisk,"" Trump said.

His initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention Chicago, though Trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is ""out of control.""

Of course, as president, Trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city; he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement.

During a press conference, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus were asked about Trump's stop-and-frisk remarks. ""The notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in New York is ludicrous, and Donald trump needs to check his facts,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York.

""We would ask Donald Trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-New York.","Donald Trump Calls for Nationwide Stop-and-Frisk Policy, Then Rolls It Back",Politifact
61,"A Japanese whaling crew has fallen victim to a dramatic full on assault by a school of killer whales, killing no less than 16 crew members and injuring 12, has reported the Japanese Government this morning.
The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (<U+65E5><U+65B0><U+4E38>), Japanís primary whaling vessel and the worldís only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the shipís processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.

The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. ìIt was horrificî claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. ìThe water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhereî he recalls in tears.

Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean.

62,"New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.

Both Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.

Clinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

While the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday.

Trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.

""I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,"" Trump said Monday on Fox News. ""I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.""

He later said, ""I've already met with a couple,"" but refused to say which ones.

Clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.

Clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.

While reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the ""path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.""

Trump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed ""the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,"" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.

Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.

""Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,"" the Trump campaign said.

The Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his ""high regard for peace-loving Muslims,"" the campaign added.

The campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship ""vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.""

Sisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.

Sitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily ""the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression."" Clinton added that she was ""anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.""

Clinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.

""If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,"" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. ""While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.""

The meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.

Trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique PeÒa Nieto earlier this year.

The meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but PeÒa Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.

Clinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's ""embarrassing international incident.""

""When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,"" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.

For her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.

Instead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.

Clinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.

Clinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian ""aggression"" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.

Currently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.

Clinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.

Clinton, according to an aide in the room, ""emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress"" and ""discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.""

Clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.

Clinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.

Sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.

""There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,"" the official said.

Trump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who ""recognize that this ideology of death"" must be extinguished.

Clinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.

Clinton, according to an aide, discussed ""the threat from North Korea"" and ""relations with China"" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.

There is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.","Clinton, Trump meet world leaders for very different reasons",Politifact

64,"Nate Smith, executive director of the Texas Nationalist Movement, looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east Ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to Smithís struggle for an independent Texas. Standing in a conference room in the Ritz Hotel in central Moscow on Sunday, Smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card.

It wasnít the only incongruous encounter taking place at the Ritz at what has been dubbed Moscowís international conference of separatists, an eclectic Kremlin-funded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for self-rule for often unlikely territories.

Amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel, Catalonian separatists and dissident Irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east Ukrainian rebels, Azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the self-proclaimed ""King of Hawaii,"" who called in via video link.

And among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve self-determination, were two Americans campaigning for Texan and Californian secession from the United States.

The conference, now in its second year, is funded largely by the Kremlin and organized by the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia, a group that closely follows government positions. The movement says it is unconnected to the Kremlin, but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by President Vladimir Putin, which provided close to $546,000 for the project, according to public records. The attendees, including the Texan delegate, had been offered free flights and accommodation.

The conferenceís organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups, but its agenda overlaps with Kremlin efforts to promote Russia as an alternative guardian for global order, at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged American imperialism.

ìOur main goal is to create a multi-polar world,î the conferenceís creator, Aleksander V. Ionov, told its participants. ìOur president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is probably the main anti-globalist in the world.î

Ionov himself, a relatively little-known businessman, has repeatedly met Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Russia is backing militarily, saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago.

Ionovís conference plays into Moscowís own long-time policy of backing separatists in its former Soviet neighbors. While jailing and harassing separatist groups at home, Moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention, most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern Ukraine. A sizable presence of pro-Russian rebel supporters was visible on Sunday, while not a single Russian separatist group took part.

All that and the anti-American flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the Kremlinís orbit.

ìItís kind of awkward I guess,î Smith said after one 30-minute denunciation of American inequity.

ABC News

Smithís group, the Texas Nationalist Movement, is campaigning for a referendum on whether Texas should exit the United States. Founded over 10 years ago, the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the Texas state GOP to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the Republican convention. Smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the Kremlin.

ìWeíre here to have a dialogue. Weíre not in agreement with all the groups that are here,î Smith said. ìWeíre here for very specific reasons. We came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of Texas.î

It was a sentiment echoed by Louis J. Marinelli from the YES California Independence Campaign, there to get his message out about his plan to make the Golden State a nation.

ìWe want to draw attention to our campaign,î Marinelli said. ìWeíre not signing an alliance with Russia or anything like that.""

The two secessionistsí urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with American foreign policy and a sense the U.S. has become dysfunctional. A gentle-mannered IT consultant married to a Russian, Marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019.

ìThe U.S. government is so dysfunctional it canít be repaired from within anymore, and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs, we could improve the quality of life for Californians,î Marinelli said.

Both men were hoping for a Donald Trump victory in the U.S. presidential elections, banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from America. The U.K.'s recent ""Brexit"" vote to leave the European Union had also heartened many attendees.

But why exactly the Kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in Moscow, few among the foreign attendees could say. Nor did they appear particularly interested.

ìIím not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference,î Smith said.

However, the conference -- and its location in one of Moscowís expensive hotels, within shouting distance of the Kremlin walls -- slots into a recognizable recent Russian strategy. Russia has been backing far right political parties in the West, in particular, reportedly funding Franceís anti-European Union party, the Front National, with a $10 million loan. The practice echoes that of the Soviet Union, which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world, but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets.

ìItís a school-book case,î said Peter Kreko, a Fulbright visiting professor at Indiana University who has studied Russiaís use of the far right. ìThe simple reason is that Russia is interested in dividing the Western world. The strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there.î

Kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering European integration and to undermine faith in Western-style liberal democracy.

ìThe tool-kit is pretty much the same as in the Soviet Union. Any kind of movements that can cause chaos,î Kreko said, adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint Russia as a champion of democracy.

Few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become Kremlin pawns, seeing it simply as a way to get their message out.

ìEverybodyís using everybody,î Marinelli said. ìWeíre using this conference for our own purposes. We want the attention so that we can get the word out, they want ..."" he trailed off before finishing. ìEverybodyís got their own agenda, right? So, thatís just the way it is.î

For most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media, attracted by the conferenceís oddity.

ìIíve talked to seven media [organizations] today. I've got to get my story out,î said Diarmuid Mac Dubhglais, international secretary for Republican Sinn FÈin, a tiny Irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of British control over Northern Ireland.

In any case, Mac Dubhglais said, he wouldnít let ìVladimir himselfî impose ideas on him.

ìIím not going to start passing out propaganda when I go home and start marching Soviet-style,"" he said.

Besides, he said, perhaps the Russian motive was altruistic. ìMaybe in fairness, they might think the cause is just,î he said then paused, before adding: ìIím hoping thatís what they think.""","Texas, California Separatists Attend Kremlin-Funded Conference",Politifact
65,"President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia.

Now, heís the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities.

Story Continued Below

Obama has cast the Saudis as ""so-called"" allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ""share"" the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to Syriaís bloody civil war.

Despite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.

That Obama and Riyadh find themselves on the same side against Congress underscores the bizarre evolution of U.S.-Saudi ties over the past eight years. An alliance once unquestioned in Washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism, but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards.

""This is clearly a relationship in transition,"" said Jon Alterman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Nobody really has a sense of what theyíre trying to transition it to.""

Just how tricky is the relationship? Two more examples: Obama is supporting the Saudis in their fight against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, even though U.S. officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the Islamic State. And many of the same U.S. lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the Saudis just this week green-lit a $1.15 billion arms sale to the country. ""Does no one sense the irony?î asked Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the Senate.

The back and forth in Washington is ""schizophrenic behavior"" that has deeply frustrated leaders in the Middle East for years, said a former senior U.S. official deeply familiar with the Arab world.

Congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The Saudis, through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists, have tried hard to stop it, waging a major PR effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdom's efforts to stop terrorists. The Saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the U.S. has never found proof of it, either. The Saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in U.S. assets to protect themselves against lawsuits.

Administration officials downplay the idea that Obama will veto the bill merely to protect Saudi Arabia. Normally, U.S. citizens aren't allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity. Obama's concern, officials say, thus goes well beyond the Saudis; he's worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the U.S. to be sued over its actions abroad.

""To pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even American businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a recent press briefing.

The perception in many quarters, however, is that Obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, were Saudi nationals. And the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 9/11 attacks raised more questions about Saudi government ties to Islamist extremists.

""We are disappointed that the president is not standing with us,"" said Mindy Kleinberg, who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers Thursday to push for a veto override. ""We have been waiting a very long time for justice, and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability.""

Whatever his motivation, Obama's decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease Saudi suspicions.

The Saudis' wariness of Obama has its roots in his comments in 2002, well before he ran for president, referring to the monarchy in Riyadh as a so-called ally. It grew after Obama sided against Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring movements, leading Saudi royals to question whether America would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own.

It deepened in 2013, after Obama decided not to stage a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is despised by the Saudis, even after Assad apparently crossed Obama's ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. And it reached a new peak in 2015 after Obama struck a nuclear deal with Iran, a Shiite theocracy that Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia views as a growing threat in the Middle East.

Still, Obama, cognizant of the need for the U.S. to maintain alliances with stable countries in the Middle East, has otherwise tried hard to allay Saudi concerns. He cut short a trip to India to rush to see the newly crowned Saudi king, Salman, in January 2015, after the previous monarch died. He also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the Saudis, in part to assuage Saudi concerns about the Iran nuclear deal.

But earlier this year, in comments to the Atlantic magazine that infuriated the Saudis, Obama appeared to reverse decades of U.S. policy that tilted heavily toward Riyadh and against Tehran.

ìThe competition between the Saudis and the Iranians ó which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen ó requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,î Obama said.

Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that Obama had ""thrown us a curve ball"" and criticizing the president for saying Americaís Gulf allies were ìfree ridersî wholly dependent on the U.S. for their security.

And in April, weeks after the Atlantic piece was published, Saudi Arabia appeared to snub Obama when he visited Riyadh for a summit by sending a lower-level official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state TV. The readouts from those meetings in Riyadh also suggested the president hadn't done much to assuage Saudi concerns, with the two sides saying they'd ""discussed"" and ""exchanged views"" more than agreeing on anything.

The president also hosted Saudi Arabiaís deputy crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, when he visited Washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdomís image in Washington. Obama made sure to praise the prince's plan to transform the Saudi economy, dubbed Vision 2030. He also tried to reassure the Saudi royal that the U.S. will back the Saudis against interference by Iran, which remains an official enemy of the United States.

But some constants in the U.S.-Saudi relationship have turned into variables, meaning that even after Obama leaves office in just a few months, the alliance could prove rocky.

The low price of oil, for example, is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy; the U.S. also relies more now on its own energy reserves, reducing Americaís addiction to Saudi oil. Some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia ó women, though still facing severe segregation, make up a growing share of the workforce; young people are more exposed than ever to the Internet and the outside world; and thousands of Saudis educated in the U.S. are now capitalizing on that experience in their country.

By all accounts, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia still maintain a strong security relationship, and U.S. officials privately say the Saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule. U.S. officials also say the Saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their Islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant.

""The close cooperation on countering violent extremists like [the Islamic State], the continued Saudi preference for American arms, the important role that Saudi Arabia plays in international energy markets and the $70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future,"" said Fahad Nazer, a former political analyst with the Saudi Embassy in Washington who now does similar work for JTG Inc.

In many ways, what Obama thinks about the Saudis matters less and less as his time in the Oval Office draws to an end. But while the Saudis will be happy to see him leave, there's great uncertainty in Riyadh about how the next president will deal with them.

Both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have voiced grave concerns about Saudi Arabia's track record of producing Islamic extremists; Clinton has said she supports the 9/11 lawsuit bill. But while Clinton would likely be a more predictable partner, the Saudis see Trump ó who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States ó as a wild card.

For now, however, the Saudis are nervously watching Congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them.

Already, some members of Congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 9/11 legislation after all, and that they may consider voting to uphold Obama's veto. Their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs, including the European Union, voice opposition to the bill. The original bill passed on voice vote in both Houses, making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record. And with the presidential election looming, the politics are even more fraught than normal.

ìSaudi Arabia has never been an especially popular actor in Washington ó a powerful one, but not popular,"" the former senior U.S. official said. ""And now, nobody in Congress wants to stick their neck out for the Saudis two-and-a-half months before the presidential election.î

66,"""I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.

The key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said ó giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing Planned Parenthoodís partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants ó a provision that had been a major point of contention.

Story Continued Below

ìSenate Republicans stand ready to move forward,î McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. ìI would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.î

McConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.

But the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood ó particularly Profamilias, the health care providerís partner in Puerto Rico ó from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.

Language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine thatís delayed Zika aid for months.

Despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said ìnoî when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.

ìClose is relative,î Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.

For instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.

But Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldnít accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.

ìLouisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,î Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. ìThey donít want to do Flint.î

Another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administrationís proposal to hand over the U.S. governmentís authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 ó a push thatís being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans ó even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats.

ìThis is the coordination of the domain names. Itís not who has control of the Internet,î Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. ìAnd every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.î

Meanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million ó which it hasnít been able to do because three of the five seats on the bankís board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.

There are other items that could fill up the Senateís legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.

Though Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.

Republicans ó who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance ó privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.

68,"North Carolina's governor has dropped a lawsuit asking a federal court to preserve the state's HB2 law limiting civil rights protections for LGBT people and regulating who uses which public bathrooms.

In court documents Friday, Gov. Pat McCrory cited ""substantial costs to the State"" as one reason for dropping his lawsuit against the federal government, writing that it did not serve the ""interests of judicial economy and efficiency.""


Businesses, performing artists and event organizers have boycotted the state since House Bill 2 was passed. In July, the NBA announced it was pulling its February All-Star Game out of Charlotte, saying in a statement, ""We do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by the current law.""

This month, the NCAA and the Atlantic Coast Conference both moved championship sporting events out of the state.

McCrory sued the federal government in May, after U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said HB2 violated both the Civil Rights Act and Title IX and threatened to withhold federal funding to the state. The Department of Justice countersued, seeking to ban enforcement on the grounds that the law is, as Lynch said at the time, ""impermissibly discriminatory.""

""This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them ó indeed, to protect all of us,"" Lynch said at a news conference.

North Carolina is also fighting another lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality. That suit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, was filed in March on behalf of Joaquin CarcaÒo, a 27-year-old transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is banned from using public men's restrooms under the law.

Some local support for the law is waning, as well. After months of bad business news and widespread condemnation by other state governments, at least two state legislators who helped pass the law now want it repealed.

North Carolina state Sens. Tamara Barringer and Rick Gunn have both backed off their initial support for the law. Barringer says she voted for the law out of concern about ""safety and particularly privacy in bathrooms."" But last week, she told NPR she has changed her mind:

""There's several factors that have changed my mind. It is having a tremendous adverse economic impact on the families of North Carolina. These are jobs. These are the way we support our families, the way we fund education.

""It is also creating the wrong impression of North Carolinians in the world or across the nation. Last week, I had the privilege of representing North Carolina on an education mission to Arizona State University.

""But at lunch, someone asked the question, 'Senator Barringer, what is this HB2 thing?' And that really caught me in my tracks, that, all the way across the country, someone is asking this.

""And then, finally, the other thing that has galvanized me is we have talked hundreds of hours... since April about HB-2. And yes, it is an important issue, but we need to move on to the business of North Carolina.""

McCrory has said he still stands by the ideas in the law, which makes it illegal for local governments in the state to pass laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination. But his office said last week that the governor would repeal the law if the city of Charlotte repeals a local ordinance protecting LGBT people from discrimination, according to the Charlotte Observer.

That local ordinance, which never took effect because the state law overruled it, would have prevented businesses from discriminating against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Charlotte, and allowed people to use the locker rooms and bathrooms corresponding to the gender with which they identify.

The Charlotte City Council considered such a repeal in May, but it was voted down. The city's mayor, Jennifer Roberts, said the issue of whether to repeal the ordinance will not be on the agenda when the city council meets Monday evening.

While city leaders ""applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn HB2,"" Roberts wrote in a statement Monday, she argued that Charlotte does not bear responsibility for the state law, noting the state Legislature can overturn it ""at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte.""",BREAKING: North Carolina Drops Anti-LGBT 'Bathroom Bill' Lawsuit Against US,Politifact

Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:

President Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.

Ryanís office has asserted that he can not be ìfiredî by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:

Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trumpís statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.

Relate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesnít say things he doesnít mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.

This isnít about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:

70,"New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!





This will blow your mindÖRead how a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women.

ìI met Stephawn when I was 19 years old,î explains Joshua Johnson on his blog.

He continues:

ìAt 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.

Johnson goes on to explain in great detail how he fell victim to a sexually promiscuous fugitive who is wanted for allegedly infecting at least 240 people with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.

Ladies, as you read Joshuaís story below, keep in mind that black women are the fastest growing HIV demographic in the U.S. due to bisexual men who in relationships with women because they are confused about their sexuality.

Gay and bisexual men, regardless of race, are more sexually promiscuous than their heterosexual counterparts, according to Seekingarrangement.com and other reports.

Authorities in New York City are offering up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of 31-year-old Isaac Don Burks, aka Stephawn Burks, Stefan Levine, Isaac Levine, Stefan Burks, and Walter Brooks.

Burks is described as an African-American male, medium brown skin, six feet two inches tall, weighing 185 pounds. The NYPD is looking for a fugitive they say has embarked on a terrifying campaign to ìinfect as many people as possibleî with the HIV virus, and they caution that his victims could run into the hundreds.

Isaac Don Burks, 31, has been indicted on eight counts of criminal transmission of HIV, prosecutors announced Friday, and warned that Burks targets people via popular gay websites and networking apps, such as Adam4Adam, Grindr, Jackd, and BGCLive.

Burks, a black gay man from West New York, NJ, just outside Manhattan, who police say may have started his ìmission to infect as many people as possibleî with HIV as far back as ten years ago, was described as ìsick in the headî by one alleged victim, who notes that Burks alluded to having possibly infected as many as 300 victims. The victrim, who did not wish to be publicly identified, recalls that Burks has been on a ìdownward spiralî since the death of his mother, and plies his prey with drugs and alcolhol, to ìbring their guard down.î

According to New York City Health Department spokesperson Kate Caraway, this is the first time a HIV infected individual has spread HIV to so many victims.

ìWe want to make sure that anyone who may have injected drugs with, who may have had sex with him, does come forward and get tested,î she Caraway. ìWe want to make sure that theyíre not spreading the virus to anyone else.î

Anyone with information regarding Burksí whereabouts is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 888-CRIMESC (888-274-6372). Your call will remain anonymous.

This makes the report we did on Craig Lamar Davis passing HIV around the Full Gospel Baptist Church seem like nothing.

Now read Joshua Johnson story in his own words below:





Isaac Burks aka Isaac Don Burks Pictured Above

I met Stephawn, (Real Name: Isaac Burks ñ Isaac Don Burks), when I was 19 years old. I had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to attend Clark Atlanta University. At 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.

You see, my father was a pastor and my mother was a physician. I came from a very stable background, and my parents were heavily into the church. They controlled everything in my life. They financed my education, sent me money every month, and paid virtually every bill that I had. They wanted to see me succeed in life, and I didnít want to disappoint them.

When I moved to Atlanta I met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation. I pulled strength from these men, and bonded with them immediately. They taught me that it was ok to be gay, and that life was too short to live my life for others. Over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men. I felt comfortable. I felt that I could express myself without judgement, andÖ. for the first time ever I felt accepted. As time passed by, I started coming out of the closet a little more each day. At first, I would never attend a gay club because of fear of being outed. My friends eventually talked me into attending a gay club for the first time. I was nervous! You see, I had a sister who attended Spelman College and four other male cousins who attended Clark. The last thing I needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation. That would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off, and they were the ones paying for my tuition, books, and college expenses.

I eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends. We loaded up into my friends Ford Explorer and headed over to a club called Traxx. Apparently, this was the gay club that everyone in Atlanta attended on Saturday. I remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym. It was huge! There had to be over 1,000 people in the place, and they were dancing the night away. Because we were underage, we couldnít drink. Apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age, and no one in my party had one. After awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it. Clubs arenít as fun when you are sober, and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off. While standing on the side I noticed a guy staring at me and smiling. He was very attractive, and every time I would catch him looking in my direction I would look the other way. This entire gay lifestyle was still new to me, so I didnít know what to take his stares for. Eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation. He told me that I looked familiar, and asked me where I was from. I told him that I was from Charlotte North Carolina, and I couldnít possibly look familiar. I had never been to a gay club, and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country. He asked me why I wasnít drinking, and I told him we couldnít buy drinks because we were all under 21. He offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense. I jumped at the offer, because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night. After all, no one comes to a club to have a bad time.

He returned minutes later with three drinks. The drinks he ordered for us were Long Island Iced Teas. I remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out. It was very strong. Rather than be rude and waste his money, I drank it slowly. Stephawn then asked why I was babysitting my drink. I asked what did he mean by that, because I had never heard the phrase used before. He told me to hurry up and finish my drink, he was going to order us another round. By the time the second round came, I was feeling nice. We continued to talk, and he kept buying me drinks.

After the third round I was borderline drunk, and so were my friends. Every time he ordered me a drink, he also ordered my friends a drink too. After awhile my friends wanted to leave, and I told him that I would catch up with him later. He asked me to stay a little longer, and promised to take me home. I ditched my friends, and for the rest of the night it was just me and him.

We ended up leaving the club an hour later. While taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on E. We pulled into an apartment complex in the Lindbergh area of buckhead. He told me to come up with him so I did. As soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me. We eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed. He started unbuckling my my pants, and I stopped him. I confessed that I was a virgin and didnít have a clue what I was doing.

He told me to relax, and that everything was cool. He said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life, and that he could teach me how to have sex. He made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off. Then he took my pants off. I was tense and nervous. I didnít know what to expect, but he was so attractive I wanted every ounce of this man. The first thing he did was start eating my ass and I moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed. Next he started sucking my d***k from the back while I was laying on my stomach. It felt amazing. I wanted to please him too, but he told me to chill and go with the flow. Then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his d***k on my ass crack. He grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand. He rubbed the lotion in my ass crack, and then put some on his index finger. He slowly put his finger inside of my ass. I moaned in extacy, because he was stroking my d***k while he was massaging my prostate with his finger. After awhile of fingering me, he tried to put his d***k in my ass raw. I immediately stopped him! I asked if he had a condom, and he said yea why? I said because I didnít come to Atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me. He ran some line about being recently tested the week before, and I said thatís cool but we just met. If we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter. He jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser. I watched him put the condom on, and then I buried my face into the pillow. It was painful at first. I didnít understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out. I had to stop him several times, because I could not take the pain. After about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient. I couldnít take the d***k, and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain. I didnít want to disappoint him, and I didnít want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied. I decided to ìman upî and squirted some more lube on my ass. I laid on my stomach, and put my face back into the pillow. He inserted his d***k inside of my ass, and this time it didnít hurt as much. He started to increase his stroke, and I had no problem taking it. He was grabbing my waist, and I attempted to throw my ass back like I had seen in the porno movies. Whatever I was doing, he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy. After 10 minutes of f***king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum. As he came I felt a warm liquid inside of my ass. I jumped up and looked back and saw his d***k without a condom on it! I screamed what happened to the condom? He grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom. There was no cum in it, and it was by the foot of the bed. I ran to the bathroom, because it felt like I had to s***t. When I used the bathroom, his cum rushed out of my ass. It was allot. I kept thinking to myself that this motherf***ker took the condom off while f***king me. That was the only explanation for cum being in my ass, because I watched him put the condom on.

I came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face. I said nigga I just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass. I asked him if he took the f***king condom off. He said no. He said that it must have broke. I wasnít buying it, and I searched around for the condom. I found the used condom on the bed, and started examining it. The condom wasnít broke at all! I rolled it out, and there was nothing wrong with it. I screamed what the f***k did you do, because this condom isnít broken. He told me that I was tripping, and I ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet. I filled the condom with water and it didnít leak at all! When I did that, he told me to get the f***k out of his house. I felt betrayed, I was scared for my life, and I was hurt. I had heard about Atlanta being one of the cities with the highest AIDS rates in the country, and I was determined not to be a statistic.

I got my things, and got out of his house. This asshole didnít even take me home, and it was 6am in the morning. As I waited outside of his apartments in the cold, I called a cab service. They arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home. The entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop. I didnít answer his calls, because I didnít want to talk to him. I was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while f***king me. There was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me. I know some guys get off by that, but I was disgusted by it.

The thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn. As the liquor wore off, I went into a deep depression. When I got to my dorm, I popped two tylenol pmís and fell alseep.

I didnít tell anyone about my experience. How could I explain that I had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected. I had just met this man. I didnít even know his real name. When my friends asked me what happened, I said nothing and gave them a look that said ìdonít ask me anymore questions!î. They didnít ask, and I didnít tell. That experience frightened me so bad that I decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education. That meant pulling back from my ìgay friendsî too, because I was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality. I started hanging more with my straight friends. After all, I had to keep my charade up. I had family that attended my school, so I couldnít be seen with a bunch of gay men 24/7.

8 months later while home for Christmas break I had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup. This was something my mother made me do ever year since I can remember. My doctor asked me was I sexually active, and I said no. I told him that I had sex once, but that was it. I wasnít sexually active, because I wasnít actively having sex. He told me that he was going to include an HIV test in my regular blood work anyway. A few days later I received a call from his office. It wasnít the doctor, it was one of the office workers. She was obviously new, because I didnít recognize her voice. She told me that I needed to come in, because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me. I was confused. I asked her what ìsomethingî was, and she said that she couldnít release this information over the phone and that I should come in Today. This was very unusual, because I had never had this happen before and I had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years. At first I thought it could be high blood pressure, because that ran in my family. There was also a chance of cancer, because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer. I borrowed my mothers car, and headed over to the doctorís office. I didnít want to scare her, so I didnít mention what I was borrowing the car for.

I will never forget what happened next. As I arrived to my doctorís office, I was told to have a seat in the waiting room. There was soft music playing that turned out to be Barry Manilowís Daybreak, and it made my stomach turn! I hated that f***king song. I was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when I was being called into my doctorís office to discuss my lab results. Before the song could end, the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room. It was cold, there was no window, and the light was very bright. Brighter than usual. He began to look over my charts and lab results. He grabbed my hand, which caught me off guard, and then said Iím sorry to have to tell you this, but your HIV results

came back positive. I swear I didnít even hear the word positive, I just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion. I said, Iím sorry but there must be some mistake. I am not sexually active. Iíve only had sex once! I havenít had oral sex, or any sexual activity with anyone but one person. He said that he would order additional tests, and they all came back positive.

I thought about committing suicide. I could not eat. I could not sleep. I could not focus on school. I couldnít do anything but cry. My doctor couldnít legally tell my mother I was HIV positive, but I was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co-pays for the HIV meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits. I tried to get in contact with Stephawn but his number was disconnected.

When I got back to school, I went over to the apartment complex where he lived but I couldnít remember the apartment number. I had no way of reaching this guy. I wanted to kill him, and i was going to. I had a butcher knife and I was going to stab him thru the heart, because I knew this guy had given me HIV, because I didnít have sex with anyone else. As time passed, I became so depressed that I eventually dropped out of school. I kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when Iím going to die soon. I lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail. I decided to drop out of school, because I didnít know how to deal with it all. I had no one to turn to. I couldnít tell my friends, and I couldnít tell my parents. Can you imagine telling your mother that you are HIV positive after a one night stand. I couldnít dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her.

Today I read the article about Isaac Burks and saw his picture. This is the same guy who told me his name was Stephawn. This is the guy that gave me HIV! He ruined my life. I finally ended up telling my parents because I could not afford to pay the co-pays for the medication and doctor visits. My mother didnít cry, and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way. Later on that night as I got up to use the bathroom I heard her crying in her room. Tears immediately started pouring down my face and I ran to the kitchen. I slit my wrist. I wanted to die. I fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family. I have been in counseling, hiv support groups, and seeing a psychiatrist every since. Accepting the fact that I am HIV positive has been very hard. I still have not been able to return to school, and I have tried to kill myself 3 times since then.

To the sick f***k Isaac Burks, also known as Stephawn who gave me HIV, I hope you rott in hell. Now that I know his real name I will contact the authorities and tell my story. Every day I hope that things will get better, and it doesnít. I ask ìWhy me?î every day. What did I do to deserve this? I have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone. I just know the minute I tell them my HIV status they will be out of the door. I am going to die alone. The last time I tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop. But I cant. I have nothing to live for. I am alive, but I am not living.

I cried as I typed this post. I relived it, but felt I had to share my story. After finally coming out to my friends with my story I later found out that there were others that this man infected with HIV.

Im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie CANNOT WIN.

I pray for you whoever you are. See my GOD doesnít allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent.

72,"AP Photo McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse A total of $170 million for the Flint water crisis is added to the WRDA bill.

Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.

In a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an ""iron-clad commitment"" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.

Story Continued Below

Late Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint.

""The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,"" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday.

Pelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill.

With Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans.

Earlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure ó which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 ó because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint.

McConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold.

""We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,"" McConnell said. ""That's certainly an option worth discussing.""

Informed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint.

But other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. ""If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,î said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin.

ìThere's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,î Durbin added.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. ìI doubt that we would turn that down,î he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction.

Senate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.

ìWhy do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood ó sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out ó for Flint when thereís a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?î argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana.

Still, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical.

Meanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commissionís ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint.

McConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.

Among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly.

Thirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolinaís Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.

(CNN) A six-year-old boy from New York has won the respect of US President Barack Obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in Omran Daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in Aleppo, Syria, was bombed.

The image of five-year-old Omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old Alex, from Scarsdale, New York, to take action.

In a handwritten letter sent to the White House, Alex asked Obama to go and collect Omran and bring him to his house where ""we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons.""

In his letter to Obama, Alex offered to teach Omran how to ride a bike.

Alex said that Omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him.

Obama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook.

ROCKFORD, Illinois ñ During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Vin Diesel took a moment to praise Rockford, Illinois residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

ìWe were just leaving the city limits of Rockford, Illinois when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that Iím not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and Iím thinking, ëSure, what the hell.í So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rockford ñ some place on State Street, I think ñ and got a burger. Great freakiní burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly.

Iím telling you, these people in Rockford are the real deal. Iím going to move there after I retire,î Diesel said with a laugh.

Diesel added later, ìYou have to understand, this is something that wouldíve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, thatís my story about Rockford, Illinois. Itís nice to know there are still places like this in America.î

""We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,"" Trump said

Boise, Idaho (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was ""trying to point out things that have to be said.""

""People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,"" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. ""For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for.""

The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.

But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.

Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.""

Now Tax Returns are brought up again?î Trump tweeted.

As always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trumpís second son argued that his fatherís tax return is ìirrelevant,î largely because ìhe knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.î He said, ìWhen you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.î

Eric continued, ìAnd while weíre on the subject, I kind of have to say, itís funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. Thatís kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, Iím not saying something thatís revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that heís president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. Thatís a catastrophe.î

It wonít matter soon anyway,î Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that ìcancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.î ìItís our way of saying ëgood jobí to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes.

Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.

The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.

Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook.

Mitch McConnell is playing hardball ó forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month.

With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats ó yet still isnít enough to get the minority party on board.

Story Continued Below

Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June.

The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday ó which funds the government until Dec. 9 ó also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.

ìThere have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So thatís what Iíve just offered,î McConnell said. ìItís the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.î

But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesnít include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

ìTo put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I havenít counted votes but our caucus isnít going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan.""

It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bankís full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded.

ìThe president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasnít done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,î White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank.

Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders.""

""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon.

ìWeíre in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,î Reid told reporters. ìIíve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], sheís not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. Itís really unfair to the American people.î

During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, ìin my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.î

Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a ìRepublican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed.

""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

81,"Donald Trump's campaign isn't alone in patronizing his own businesses: taxpayers are indirectly doing so, too.

Federal Election Commission records show that the U.S. Secret Service has paid the Trump campaign about $1.6 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies.

Story Continued Below

Itís standard practice for the agency ó which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials ó to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates.

In fact, the Secret Service has reimbursed the Clinton campaign, too: $2.6 million so far this cycle.

The difference with Trump is that one of his companies, TAG Air, Inc., owns the plane, so the government is effectively paying him.

The Clinton campaign, by contrast, mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called Executive Fliteways in which the Clintons do not have any ownership interest.

ìThe taxpayers are actually reimbursing Trump for the travel of the Secret Service agents,"" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm Akerman LLP. ""It's just another example of how the Trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at Trump-owned facilities.""

Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to questions about the Secret Service payments by saying ìeverything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.î

Secret Service spokeswoman Nicole Mainor said the FEC ìspecifically requires security personnel such as the Secret Service to reimburse campaigns for seatsî on charter aircraft.

A POLITICO analysis of FEC records found that, through the end of August, Trumpís campaign has spent at least $8.2 million at Trump's own businesses, including to hold events at his hotels, buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his Manhattan office tower.

But the biggest chunk of the expenses, almost $6 million, were to TAG Air, Inc.

Trump, who once said ìI could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it,î has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree. He has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail, leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets.

The campaign in a statement on Thursday rejected that criticism as ìmisleading and flat out wrong,î pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at Trump's businesses is far less than the $54 million of his own money that Trump has pumped into the campaign.

The statement explained the campaignís payments to TAG Air and other Trump-owned companies by saying ìthe campaign has used known quantities as far as event space, air travel and accommodations, and has fulfilled all FEC requirements throughout the campaign.î

The government's practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their Secret Service details dates from an era when campaigns were lower-budget affairs, the logic being candidates shouldn't have to use their own resources on required security, according to Craig Engle, a political lawyer at Arent Fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the Federal Election Commission.

""It's basically just calling it even,"" Engle said. ""It's either Trump making a contribution to the U.S. government, or the U.S. government reimburses the Trump campaign for its expenses.""

The same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates. The journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs. So itís conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the Trump campaign for the cost of staying in a Trump-owned hotel or flying on a Trump-owned plane.

The Secret Service could also end up paying Trump's hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there. But those expenses don't appear in FEC reports because the government pays them directly.

The agency paid the Trump campaign an additional $724,000 for air travel that was refunded, according to the FEC reports, which do not offer an explanation for the refund.

Of course, Trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail. In August, Trumpís campaign spent $232,800 on security-related costs, including payments to private companies such as Xmark LLC, Black Tie Protection Services and KS Global Group, as well as local police in places he visited.

Chelsea Clinton, the CEO, has been charged with fraud and a warrant issued for her arrest. But, following this news, Clintons were nowhere to be found for an interview.

The reason behind the shutdown is the alleged ëípay for playíí donations that saw rich and powerful terrorists gain access to Washington DC in exchange for cash. During Clintonís time as Secretary of State, itís been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with Obama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. Then, the creator of ISIS, Osama Bin Laden was sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death.

So, it all comes down to how Chelsea Clinton used her family foundationís cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents.

As workers slung a strap around the statueís waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags.

ìThis historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,î Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.

The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama.

ìIt will be niceî, Landrieu said, ìto see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.î

The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars.

Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors.

Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.

ìWe would have preferred it to be in the daytime,î Johnson said, ìso everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.î

However, he also added that, ìWeíre not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid. Weíre not going to let them instill fear.î

We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though itís a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.

If youíre one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than youíre prepared for.

NASA has put out an ad looking for people whoíre willing to take part in their ìRest Studiesî ñ a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.

So what is the exact purpose of these studies?

These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronautsí health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.

The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.

This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:

Examining how the astronautsí changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.

Examining if the astronautsí physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.

Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.

The studyís participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.

The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.









The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether youíre in the exercising or non-exercising group.

Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days youíll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days youíll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! Youíll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.

During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your bodyís immunity system.

But is it worth it?

You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you canít take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.

This will probably be your only opportunity to say that youíve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.","NASA Will Pay You $18,000 To Stay In Bed And Smoke Weed For 70 Straight Days",Politifact
87,"HERE Is WHAT WILL HAPPEN If The DEEP STATE TAKES DOWN PRESIDENT TRUMP & Itís NOT PRETTY Ö FOR THEM

ìThe tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants.î ñ Thomas Jefferson

ELDER PATRIOT ñ Corrupt politicians ignore Jeffersonís directive to their own detriment. Itís no longer political, itís personal.

Americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of Donald Trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the Freedom Movement genie back in the bottle.

Conservative Senator Ted Cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters.

Cruz, who had the most high profile personality clash with Donald Trump during the Republican primary process nevertheless embraced Trumpís America First agenda and said, ìIf weíre given the White House and both houses of Congress and we donít deliver, I think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets. And I think quite rightly.î

Candidate Trump promised many things ñ border control, lower taxes, fairer trade relations, a balanced budget, healthcare that puts the people first not the government, safer communities, and ñ to the extent possible ñ an end to foreign wars. What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?

After four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans ñ notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham ñ have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.

So, what gives?

Well, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trumpís promise to ìDrain the Swamp.î

As we reported yesterday, ìAn F.B.I. agent with ëintimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton caseí told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.î

The criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasnít interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.

Democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.

One Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nationís loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.

Today, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their childrenís God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they arenít the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.

Donald Trumpís presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.

These patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trumpís Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.

No amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.

So why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? Itís because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.

And, now that theyíve been caught robbing the worldís largest bank ñ the U.S. treasury ñ they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.

Washingtonís criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. Itís time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.

EDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.

HERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP

ìImpeach!î Itís been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word ñ long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obamaís administration ñ but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, itís back with a vengeance.

Democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the ìIî word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Some members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked ìWatergate.î

Now the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.

Wasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the leftís impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is Americaís new Richard Nixon.

ìWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,î says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. ìNow, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: Iím not going to stop asking them.î

Meanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.

The posters read: ìIf you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americansí tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. Ö Resign now.î

But constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned ìimpeachmentî enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?

At this time, thereís no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.

ìThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,î Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:

For the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.

However, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless ìgotchaî announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.

A good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the ìdue administration of justice.î

However, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence ìcorruptlyî when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term ìcorruptlyî is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted ìwith the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.î Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.

Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.

Here is what Chaffetz said:

ìPresident Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Hereís what he said: ëYou do a great job. Listen, I understand Iím the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Donít slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.í If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of ëdonít slow down,í I think was a good message.î

WATCH:

The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clintonís email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasnít yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.

Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. Itís about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she wonít make it out of this investigation so easily.

Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. ìI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process thatís been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,î Rubio asserted.

ìIím just totally against the whole shebang, I wonít deny it,î Rubio said. ìI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be.

He added: ìThat is why I believe that all rape victims should be put into protective custody where they would be given full-time round the clock care so that they could recover. However, I also feel that these people must be under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who would be in charge of determining whether or not the ones who got pregnant are planning to have an abortion, and of course, stopping them before things get out of control.î

Asked how soon such a plan could be put in action, Rubio replied: ìDonít know yet, first thingís first here. I need to start by winning the election in order to be able to change this country for the better.î/SOURCE

Trump on Fox News Tuesday defended making critical remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's weight gain back in the 1990s. The Republican nominee said she had ""gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.""

Ryan, who has been critical of Trump's comments in the past, did not bite on this one, however.

""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it,"" Ryan said.

""I think this debate, I think people, met their expectations, and I think Hillary gave a very polished, well-rehearsed status quo defense and I think Donald Trump gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quo,"" Ryan added.

93,"HBOís Real Time host Bill Maher ñ someone not often inclined to side with Donald Trump ñ said that Trump is right about profiling in the context of how to deal with terrorism. Hereís what he said:

ìHe is for profiling, thatís what he said. But he said we should do it the way Israel does. And, like, every once in while Donald Trump says something right. Because we profile already, we just do it stupidly. All police work is profiling. Discrimination does not mean prejudice; discrimination means telling un-like things apartÖ

ìWhat they do is they hire really smart people. This is not the TSA, which is just guys giggling at your balls when theyíre looking ó a screener. If we would pay people $100,000 to do this job, we could get the kind of people who do it in Israel.

ìAnd, again, weíre just talking about a few questions. Weíre not talking about the rubber hose or sending you to a black site. I mean, I donít think this is too much of a sacrifice to ask.î

Heís definitely right about the TSA. Their scanners and pat-down agents donít do anything to prevent terrorism. Not only has the TSA caught zero terrorists and stopped zero terrorist attacks, they have a 95% failure rate. That means, that theyíll catch contraband roughly 5% of the time. The rest of the time, it gets through. Itís a wonder that we havenít dealt with another 9/11-style attack over the past 15 years. How does an institution with such an abysmal track record even exist? (Dumb question, I knowÖitís government, so of course, itís going to be nothing but expensive and ineffective.)

Pagliano failed to show for a second hearing on Clinton's emails and private server

Washington (CNN) Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them.

The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear ""betrays a naked political agenda.""

House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify.

""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt.""

Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.

The rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 peopleówomen wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. ìWeíre very proud of it,î says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. ìThis whole countyís very, very patriotic.î

This was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often goneóhistory is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.

But for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolinaís flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monumentsó223óthan any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the ìNew Southî and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and itís a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.

Though a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governorís decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginiaís southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansionóknown as the Last Capitol of the ConfederacyóConfederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.

That rulingóalong with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the stateóprompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. ìIf you eliminate these monuments and memorials, youíre taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the countryóto learn the good, the bad and ugly,î Poindexter says.

Many of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.

ìEvery little statueís a part of a much larger discussion and movement,î says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. ìAfrican-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that theyíre using it for.î

Mark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. ìMy ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,î Whitaker says.

Now, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. ìThese monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,î he says.

Many of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.

But even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouthís monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. ìWe believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,î Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so ìthere has been protection all along.î

When the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.

Back in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents donít want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monumentóa position Whitaker finds ridiculous. ìWhy now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, weíre concerned about cost?î

He says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. ìWeíre on solid legal grounds to remove it,î he says. ìWe just need four votes.î

Other Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the cityís entire historic landscape.

He asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville ìby telling the full story of race through our public spaces.î The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.

In the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic siteóthe place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.

Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. Itís also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled ìBlack Lives Matterî on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monumentsí removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leadersósuch as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. ìRather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginiaís history,î Jones said in a statement last summer.

Delegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although heís fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, ìItís far better than tearing down the current ones.î

In his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is ìirrelevant.î ìThey need to be respected,î he says. ìThey didnít know what we know today. Thatís why these monuments are important.î

Ayers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. ìThe white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,î he says. ìTheyíve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. Itís an amalgam of power and weakness.î

ìTheyíre meant to do work,î Ayers says. ìThe work that they were meant to do, in some ways theyíre still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.î

In Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls ìThe War Between the States.î Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.

One of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, ìwe just donít have a copy of the actual check.î

Poindexter says Franklin County ìlost hundreds of its best menî in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was ìa horrible processî that had a big impact on the region.

Today, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an ìAî rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the stateís median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexterís efforts to save war monuments. ìWe didnít want anybody pulling any monuments down,î Stanley says.

Soon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the countyís Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.

Civil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginiaís Blue Ridge. ìTo be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.î

Yet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the societyís website, ìSpecial emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.î

Confederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and heís known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. ìHe became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,î says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.

Speaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isnít ready to surrender, either. He doesnít know whether heíll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasnít ruled it out. ìIf you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?î he says. ìYou canít change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.î

96,"There is not a day that goes by that we donít hear about a Muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world, but that hasnít stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity. Those of us that criticize the so-called ìreligion of peaceî are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for ìIslam anti-blasphemyî laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.

Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.

According to Minneapolisí local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to ìharass them.î The Star Tribune reported:

The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.

The service, operated through the cityís 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any ìharassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,î according to a city news release issued on Monday.

The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.

ìSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,î Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the cityís website. ìIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.î

The cityís Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. ìIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,î Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the cityís website.

The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolisí mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: ìI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trumpís desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.î The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberalís alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, donít they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they donít realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslimís demands. This ìanti-blasphemyî hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germanyís approach in the 1930ís when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the ìNBC Nightly Newsî anchor of mirroring Crowleyís infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night.

In an interview with ìFox and Friends,î Giuliani said he watched the debate two times ó once live, ìand then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.î

Story Continued Below

Donald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Mondayís faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an ìact of terror.î (PolitiFact rated Romneyís criticism ìhalf true,î noting that Obama did say ìact of terrorî right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak ìconsistently in the days that followed."")

Giuliani took issue with Holt ìignorantlyî attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.

A federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued.

ìThe thing thatís wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,î Giuliani said. ìHeís wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.î

The former mayor maintained that ìevery cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of Americaî but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt ìbecause she failed the bar exam.î

ìBut Iím not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,î he continued. ìAnd Iíd like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if youíre gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.î

ìIím a lawyer. Iím not a moderator who misrepresents on television,î Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. ìIím a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night ó if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if youíre gonna interrupt and youíre gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.î

Giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being ìcompletely unprofessionalî and ìtotally unethicalî and suggesting that ìhe should have had enough energy to check the sourcesî regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War.

ìI saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,î Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern.

ìA hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,î Giuliani said.

99,"Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public

Australia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public. NBC news predicted that all Americans would be microchipped by 2017, but it seems Australia may have already beaten them to it. Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system.

Now, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it.

Under the headline ëAustralians embracing super-human microchip technologyí, Australiaís premier media outlet news.com.au (News Corp Australia) reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand.

Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.

She told news.com.au:

ìYou could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs itís the same technology as Paypass, so Iím hoping youíll be able to pay for things with it.î

ìWith Opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. Any door with a swipe card Ö it could open your computer, photocopier. Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.î

The microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. In her interview with the Australian news outlet, Shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle:

ìMy nana wants one. Iíve had more opposition to my tattoos than Iíve ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.î

In fact, the 27-year-old has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens where for just $80 to $140, people can become so called ìsuper humans.î On the same day this news story broke, Shanti appeared at Austarliaís launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided, alongside American implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra.

As you can see, the push for RFID microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology, is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become ìsuper human,î but clearly if you become part machine/computer, that means there will be someone who can control that technology. If you think the elites wouldnít capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously donít know history very well.

Amal Graafstra, who became one of the world first RFID implantees back in 2005, just made headlines recently in the US with a prototype of the worldís first implant-activated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology.

Heís written a book, spoken at TEDx and also appeared in a number of documentaries.

In an interview with the Australian media outlet, Amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has ìgiven me the ability to communicate with machines. Itís literally integrated into who I am.î

Shanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today, which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe.

Ever since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all werenít living as ësuper-humansí.

Glenn Beck, a former Ted Cruz surrogate, suggested Monday that heíd have been better off backing Marco Rubio in the Republican presidential primary and laced into the Texas senator for throwing his support behind Donald Trump late last week.

ìFor the very first time, I heard Ted Cruz calculate, and when that happened, the whole thing fell apart for me, and itís my fault,î Beck said on his radio show.

Story Continued Below

ìItís my fault,î Beck continued. ìI should have said: ëYou know who can win? You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and thereís about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and heís kind of a politician, but heís a different kind of politician. Heís a young politician. Heís a Hispanic, He can win. Letís go for it.í""

Instead, Beck sought ìa truly honorable manî in Cruz ó ìand that will always let you down,î he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.

ìIím not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,î Beck said. ìHe is just a politician first. Iíve never put him into the category of a politician, and thatís my fault. He is a politician.î

For his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.

After Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).

ìSo a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross ó itís still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, ëYes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,í I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because itís a binary choice?î Beck asked.

ìYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,î Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.

Beck, however, wasnít satisfied. ìThis is information that you had in Cleveland ó and hang on just a second before you respond ó you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,î Beck said. ìSo you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: ëOh, my gosh, heís now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly thereís a reason to believe him.íî

Despite his ìsignificant disagreementsî with Trump, Cruz said, itís a binary choice.

ìIím asking for new information. Iím asking you for new information,î Beck said. ìYou knew all the things that youíre saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? Whatís new?î

Cruz pointed to the Trump campaignís release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.

ìWe discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,î Cruz said.

After Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. ìNow, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,î Cruz said. ìI hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising ëI will nominate from these 21,í I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, thatís a clear choice.î

Cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that heís always been ìNever Hillaryî but not ever ìNever Trump.î He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.

ìMy speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,î Cruz said. ìBoth of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.î

After Cruzís appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. ìHe could have come on and said, ëLook, guys, hereís the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,í and I know that, because so are mine,î he said. ìíMy donors, who are all in with the GOP, theyíre all saying Iíll never fund ó I wonít fund you for the Senate. I wonít fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?íî

101,"Story highlights Clinton is offering voters an implicit contrast with Trump

Clinton will outline a series of policy proposals for people with disabilities

Chappaqua, New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton's economic speech on Wednesday in Orlando will focus on how the United States can create an economy that values people with disabilities, an attempt to contrast the former secretary of state with Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Clinton, an aide said Tuesday, will propose an economy that ""welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, rewards them fairly, and treats them with respect.""

Wednesday's speech is Clinton's fourth in a series of addresses where the former first lady is attempting to talk more about her values and proposals and less about Trump. Clinton has so far given ""Stronger Together"" speeches on faith, community service and children and families.

While those speeches have focused more on Clinton, they have not been devoid of Trump contrast. In all three speeches, Clinton has tried to keep her talk of Trump to a minimum, but they have cast him as an ill-prepared candidate who should not be president. And Wednesday's speech will be no different.

102,"Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead.

Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasnít utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House.

ìItís kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,î said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. ìBut Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal heís eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trumpís orders from drive-through windows and scoop the Presidentís ice cream from the carton.î

Mr. Trumpís favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the Presidentís eating habits to the press.

ìItís borderline creepy,î the staffer said. ìThe first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like heís dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. Itís gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.î

Mr. Trumpís McDonalds habits are even weirder.

ìHe orders the same thing every time,î said the staffer. ìHe orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&Mís. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.î

No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors.

",White House Chef Quits Because Trump Has Only Eaten Fast Food For 6 Months ñ The Halfway Post,Politifact
103,"A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his fatherís inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case itís not Donald Trump. Itís Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.

Like Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginiaís only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trumpís strongest states.

Story Continued Below

West Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49ñ31 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sandersí 51 percent in the stateís May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.

Thatís led to a dynamic in which West Virginiaís GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. Itís very nearly the opposite of whatís happening in other states with close races.

ìAcross the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, itís pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,î says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabatoís Crystal Ball at the University of Virginiaís Center for Politics. ìThis is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.î

In this race, Trump isnít a drag on Republicans; heís an asset.

The reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with ìwar on coalî rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. Itís hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russiaís OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.

Cole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but heís no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.

In a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.

ìIf you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,î says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. ìIf you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are knownóthe wall, universal health care, the coal industryóbut so much of whatís driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.î

Justice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. Heís flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he wonít vote for Clinton and dismissed Coleís claim that he supports Obama as ìcomplete dog snot.î

And while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate ìisnít focused on the national political circus,î the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. ìJim is no politician,î says Herring. ìHe is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.î

At the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.

Many doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. ìDo I think Justice has a lead? Yes,î says Gates. ìDo I think itís double digits? No.î

Some of that is because Justiceís industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOPís otherwise effective ìwar on coalî messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.

ìIf youíre going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,î says Dave ìMudcatî Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said heís voting for Trump, says voters donít trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. ìShe said sheís going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners donít want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.î

If youíre going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,î says one Democratic strategist.

But Saunders doesnít have kind words for Justice either: ìHeís screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.î

Cole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justiceís business record over the next several weeks. ìJim Justice is a coal operator, but heís not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,î Gates says. ìHis legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.î

That record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice ìstands outî among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.

The problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justiceís mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. Thatís an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.

The pattern apparently extends to Justiceís other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.

Justiceís mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.

Both Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy thatís suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.

According to the U.S. Census, West Virginiaís 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.

Mines sit idle as a string of industry giantsó Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energyófiled for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, itís unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.

The coal industryís struggles havenít just hurt West Virginiaís employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.

Justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, heís brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saintsí training camp to the Greenbrier.

In late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.

Justice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrierís reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.

Whether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabatoís Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governorís race from ìLeans Republicanî to ìToss-up.î ìWeíre being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,î Kondik says.

Trump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governorís race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. Thatís why Coleís campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal ìwar on coal.î Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesnít matter, so long as theyíre not voting for Justice.

In his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: ìAt the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do whatís best for Jim Justice.î

That line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether whatís in Justice and Trumpís best interests is in theirs, too.

104,"Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to ìhunt or kill deerî and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency.

She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an ìassault weaponsî ban and said, ìIím with the majority today, taking a stand.î

Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that ìthe fact that youíre even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me youíre ignorant. Donít you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?î

Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that ìat one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly donít possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone whoís illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ëthe 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?í I mean, really.î

ìAnd what worried me even more,î she continued, ìwas the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, Iím sitting there, thinking, ëOoookaaay, someone obviously wasnít paying attention during history class ñ a lot of someones, apparently ñ hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.íî

Carlson also added, ìI mean, I know the education in our country isnít the best in the world, but I figured weíd at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. Whatís the next thing Iím going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, Iím not buying it.î

ìLike, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really donít know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube?

105,"A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.

The UKís Express reports:

Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein.

The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the childís mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.

During the trial Jama B. boasted: ìIím a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.î

Ö

Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: ìit was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.

ìTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. Heís better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.



Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.

A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence.

Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, ìRape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case.

ìTherefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesnít matter ñ it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.î

Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.

Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, ìThe court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.

ìThe fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,î she added. ìHe is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.î

Whatís even worse is the comments by the familyís attorney.

ìIt was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,î Peter Boysen said. ìTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. Heís better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.

Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not.

Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing.

ìThe incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,î wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ìThis is the verdict that shames you all.î

People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire.

Donít think it wonít be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when theyíve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not.

For the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scottís wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasnít armed and was only carrying a book.

As usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scottís leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another ìproofî that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.

As it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and thereís no reason to think he wouldnít have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:

Rakeyia Scottís cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gunóeven as he brandished a gun in front of themónow appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the childrenís schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment theyíd called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, ìHe is no longer a threat to me and my family.î But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. ìHe said he is a ëkillerí and we should know that,î she wrote. She said the man sheíd been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.

The Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah ñ OK.

Scottís wife told officers he didnít own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that couldíve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, theyíre doing so over a man who couldíve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened wouldíve been an accomplice to their murders.","TRUTH COMES OUT!
